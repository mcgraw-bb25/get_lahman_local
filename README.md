Sean Lahman (http://seanlahman.com/) has built a tremendously valuable database which contains 
nearly every statistic one could ever want about Major League Baseball.

The database can be found here: http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/

This library is a utility that can be used to download the database locally and build a SQLite 
database with all of the tables, found at ../app/db/lahman.db.  Therefore this requires that you
have SQLite installed locally. If you don't have SQLite, go here: https://www.sqlite.org/download.html

To develop these libraries I'm using Ubuntu and Python 3 and a virtual environment with the
installed requirements file.  I cannot guarantee these files will work on OS X or Windows, though
I'd like to test on those platforms eventually.
